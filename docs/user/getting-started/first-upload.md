# Your First Upload

This guide gets you from zero to a working gallery upload in under 5 minutes, using TurboImageHost — no credentials required.

## 1. Enable TurboImageHost

In the right panel, you'll see the **Upload Workers** table listing all available hosts. Right-click **turboimagehost** and select **Enable Host**.

## 2. Add a Gallery

Drag a folder of images from your file manager into the main gallery table. The folder name becomes the gallery name. BBDrop will scan the images automatically.

You can also drag ZIP, RAR, or 7Z archives — BBDrop will extract them and queue the contents.

!!! tip
    You can also use **File > Add Folders** or the Windows Explorer right-click menu to add galleries.

## 3. Start the Upload

Click **Start** in the toolbar, or right-click the gallery and select **Start Selected**. You'll see progress update in real time — image count, percentage, and upload speed.

## 4. Get Your BBCode

When the upload completes, the gallery status changes to **Completed**. Right-click the gallery and choose **Copy BBCode** to copy the generated BBCode to your clipboard.

You can also click **View BBCode** to preview it, or find the saved BBCode file in the `.uploaded` subfolder inside your gallery folder.

## Next Steps

- **Want more control over thumbnails and galleries?** Set up [IMX.to](../guides/image-hosts.md) for gallery renaming, API key authentication, and more thumbnail options.
- **Need download links?** Add [file hosts](../guides/file-hosts.md) to automatically create and upload archives.
- **Customize your output?** Create [BBCode templates](../guides/templates.md) with placeholders and conditional logic.
